immutable events for stateful db processing

secondary indexing

application cache management

request hits cache.. hit or miss

if !hit
db.get()
cache.put()
return

traditional problems
- cache invalidation.. when to invalidate?  
- race conditions (concurrent writing to cache/db)
- cold start / bootstrapping (on fresh boot all requests will go to db and overload)



hacking attempts

1) brute force of failed logins.
2) external username & password combos taken from 3rd parties on internet.

- anomaly detection
- real time blocking of suspicious users

Suspicious activity:

- username change
- password reset
- user search
