You cannot use stash outside of a node, as it is meant to copy "stashed" files from the orchestrating Master to the node that runs the code.

jenkinsfile release:
def lastCommit = sh returnStdout: true, script: 'git log -1 --pretty=%B'

if (lastCommit.contains("[maven-release-plugin]")){
            sh "echo  Maven release detected"  //dont trigger build

        } else {
            sh "echo Last commit is not from maven release plugin" //do build steps 
            <..build Job...>
        }

Configure your IDEA to pick up Jenkinsfile as a groovy file: Prefs > File Types > Groovy > Add the Jenkinsfile
Then your Jekinsfile will be compiled in the IDE and you will see compile errors before Runtime
