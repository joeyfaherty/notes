- Signed variables, such as signed integers will allow you to represent numbers both in the positive and negative ranges. For example, an unsigned byte can represent values from 0 to 255, while signed byte can represent -128 to 127.

- Unsigned variables, such as unsigned integers, will only allow you to represent numbers in the positive.

- Unsigned and signed variables of the same type (such as int and byte) both have the same range (range of 65,536 and 256 numbers, respectively), but unsigned can represent a larger magnitude number than the corresponding signed variable.
